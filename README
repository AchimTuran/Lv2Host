      Lv2Host

This is a very simple C++ class that will load an
LV2 plugin. I do not claim that this is the best 
way to load plugins, or the only way. It is a way
though.

It uses the Lilv library, written by David Robbilard
(see http://drobilla.net/software/lilv/ for details)

The interface is designed to allow easy interaction
with JACK clients, ie: request based processing, and
processing "nframes" at a time.

notices at the top of the files for info.
